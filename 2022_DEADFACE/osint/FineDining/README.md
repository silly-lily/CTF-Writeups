### FINE DINING
Turbo Tactical is trying to collect data on DEADFACE members. There was talk in Ghost Town about a member whose father owned a restaurant. If we can figure out where their father's restaurant is located, maybe we can narrow down where the member lives.

Submit the flag as `flag{flag-text}`.

#### Ghost Town
The first thing we did was Google search for `Ghost Town DEADFACE`.

Then once on the Ghost Town website, we used the search bar to search for `restaurant`.

Then we looked at the messages on the Ghost Town forum and saw this one about a newspaper article.
