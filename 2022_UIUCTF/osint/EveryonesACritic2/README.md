# Everyones A Critic 2
Everyones A Critic 2 is an osint challenge that is an extension of Everyones A Critic 1. In the first challenge, we found the discord user reviewing UIUCTF. Now we need to find his YouTube Channel. First we go to youtube and search for `Chuck Lephucke`.

## YouTube Channel
We notice the first user had the same name and profile picture as the discord user from Everyone's A Critic 1, so we take a look at the user's YouTube profile.
