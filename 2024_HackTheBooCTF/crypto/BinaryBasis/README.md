### Binary Basis
In the depths of an old tomb, a cryptic puzzle guarded a powerful relic. Many had attempted to break its code, but none had succeeded. This time, a daring cryptographer discovered a faint inscription on the wallâ€”a clue, seemingly meaningless, about pairs and shadows of two. As they delved into the cipher, the hint began to make sense, guiding their steps through the labyrinth of numbers. But as the final secret unraveled, the crypt echoed with a low whisper: "Some things are better left in darkness." The relic was revealed, but the curse had only just begun.

#### Recovering the Primes

Looking at the challenge files, we see $n$ is the product of 16 primes $p_{0},..,p_{15}$, $e$ is the encryption key, and $c$ is the encrypted flag:

```python
# source.py
FLAG = open('flag.txt', 'rb').read()

primes = [getPrime(128) for _ in range(16)]

n = prod(primes)
e = 0x10001
m = bytes_to_long(FLAG)
c = pow(m, e, n)
```

We can make the equations:

$
n = p_{0}...p_{15}\\
e = 0x10001\\
c = m^e \pmod{n}\\
$

Additionally, we see that the $treat$ variable is a calculation using the primes:

```python
# source.py
treat = sum([primes[i]*2**(4919-158*(2*i+1)) for i in range(16)])
```

We can make an equation for $treat$ which is the sum of primes each with increasing coefficient powers of $2$:

$
treat = \sum_{i=0}^{15}2^{4919-158*(2*i+1)}p_{i}
treat = \sum_{i=0}^{15}2^{4919-158*(2*i+1)}p_{i}\\
treat = 2^{4919-158*(2*15+1)}+p_{15}+2^{4919-158*(2*14+1)}p_{14}+..+2^{4919-158*(2*14+1)}p_{15}\\
treat = 2^{21}p_{15}+2^{337}p_{14}+..+2^{4761}p_{15}\\
$

Now if we divide by the coefficient power in front of $p_{15}$, we can recover $p_{15}$:

$
treat = 2^{21}p_{15}+2^{337}p_{14}+..+2^{4761}p_{0}\\
treat = 2^{21}[p_{15}+2^{316}p_{14}+..+2^{4740}p_{0}]\\
\frac{treat}{2^{21}} = p_{15}+2^{316}p_{14}+..+2^{4740}p_{0}\\
p_{15} \equiv \frac{treat}{2^{21}} \equiv p_{15}+2^{316}p_{14}+..+2^{4740}p_{15} \equiv p_{15}+0*p_{14}+..+0*p_{15} \pmod{2^{316}}
$

We update treat by dividing by $2^{21}$ and subtracting by $p_{15}$:

$
treat = 2^{21}p_{15}+2^{337}p_{14}+..+2^{4761}p_{0}\\
treat := \frac{treat}{2^{21}}-p_{15} = 2^{337}p_{14}+..+2^{4761}p_{0}\\
$

#### Factoring n

Using Python, we can recover $p_{14}$ the same way we recovered $p_{15}$. We repeat this process until we have recovered all the primes: 

```python
# soln.py
acc = 0
primes = []
for i in range(15,-1,-1):
    
    power = 0x1337-158*(2*i+1)
    adjusted_power = power-acc
    adjusted_multiple = int(2**adjusted_power)
  
    treat = treat//adjusted_multiple
    acc+=adjusted_power
    
    next_power = 0x1337-158*(2*(i-1)+1)
    adjusted_next_power = next_power-acc
    adjusted_next_multiple = int(2**adjusted_next_power)

    prime = treat%adjusted_next_multiple
    treat-=prime
    primes.append(prime)
```

#### Finding d

After recovering the primes, we can compute the decryption key $d$:

$
m \equiv c^d \pmod{n}\\
m \equiv (m^{e})^d \pmod{n}\\
m \equiv m^{ed} \pmod{n}
$

By definition of mod:

$
m \equiv m^{ed} \pmod{n}\\
m \equiv (m^{x*phi(n)+1}) \pmod{n}
$

Since $m$ and $n$ are coprime, by Euler's theorem:
$
m \equiv m*m^{x*phi(n)} \pmod{n}\\
m \equiv m*m^{x*phi(n)} \pmod{n}\\
m \equiv m*(m^{(phi(n))^{x}}) \pmod{n}\\
m \equiv m*(1^{x}) \pmod{n}\\
m \equiv m \pmod{n}
$

#### Decryption
Using Python, we can find the inverse of $e$ and then decrypt:

```python
# soln.py
phi = prod([prime-1 for prime in primes])
d = inverse(e,phi)
m = pow(c,d,n)
m = long_to_bytes(m).decode()
```
