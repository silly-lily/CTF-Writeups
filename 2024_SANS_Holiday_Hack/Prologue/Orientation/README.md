***Jingle Ringford***
> Welcome to the Geese Islands and the 2023 SANS Holiday Hack Challenge!<br><br>
I'm Jingle Ringford, one of Santa's many elves.<br><br>
...<br><br>
Just kidding! It's actually the 2024 SANS Holiday Hack Challenge!<br><br>
And although we're on Frosty's Beach on Christmas Island, we'll soon be on our way back to the North Pole.<br><br>
I thought it best to wait here for people that heard we're on the Geese Islands but may not know we're leaving.<br><br> 
I haven't seen Santa since we started packing up, but he always asks me to give a quick orientation to newcomers, so I'm continuing the tradition.

> Well, that's it, now you're orientated! Feel free to get yourself settled in, establish a cohort with others, or just explore this lovely island. Just be careful where you walk as we are moving around some pretty heavy crates.<br><br>
Oh, while we're preparing everything to set sail for the North Pole, I heard Poinsettia McMittens and Angel Candysalt could use some assistance. I'm sure they'll appreciate any help you can provide!<br><br>
We'll let you know when the boat leaves, but for now relax, enjoy the sun, and most importantly, have FUN!
